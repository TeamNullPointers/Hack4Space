# Team Null Pointers

Our problem space: *Air quality degradation over time".*
Things to make more specific:
    - what time frame?
    - what defines "good" and "worse" air quality?
    - where are our datasets coming from?

Right now we're doing global, may reduce to usa

 ## Case study: California

  #### right now we're focusing on california for reasons. (list reasons here). We can expand later if we need to
  	- Los Angeles
  	- San Francisco
  	- San Diego
  	- Sacramento
  	- Humboldt Country (Eureka, Arcata)
